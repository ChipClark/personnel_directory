February 2019 (version beta 1.3)
Update 1.3: The update addresses these issues.

Maps are internal to the application making this mobile friendly. 
Clicking on an office will take the user to the person located in that office. 

Known Issues: 
 
 - filters are now always available. There is no need to click on "Advance Search."
 
 - Officer Services staff can be found by searching for "Office Services"

 - Some people have the wrong office number, office, and/or phone number listed in their records. 
   This is a data issue and is being addressed. 

 - Hover over office no longer works, but location of the person is highlighted.
